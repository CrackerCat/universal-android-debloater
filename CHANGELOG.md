# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The sections should follow the order `Packaging`, `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`
and `Removed`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Multi-user support (#16): You can now debloat/restore for any user of the phone (not only the primary user 0). 
   - `Multi user mode` setting (default to on for Android 5+) allowing to remove packages for all users ([a work profile is another user](https://developer.android.com/work/managed-profiles)) instead of only the selected user.
   - User switcher (picklist).
- New themes! (#11) : light, dark and lupin. Lupin theme is now the new default theme. Themes can be changed from the settings.
- Description field scrollbar: you can now scroll long description (#40).

## Fixed
- [Regression] Unsafe packages can be deleted without enabling `expert mode`.
- The refresh button doesn't update settings when a (new) phone is connected.
- [Regression] Restore buttons are disabled when connecting an Android 8.0 phone.
- Refresh icon does not appear (#17)

## [0.2.2] - 2021-09-30

## Fixed
- Crash when connecting a LG device (#33)

## [0.2.1] - 2021-09-28

## Added
- Software version in the navigation panel

## Packaging
- `wgpu` renderer is not the default renderer (you don't need to add `--features wgpu` if you want to build UAD with `wgpu`)

### Fixed
- Exported selection not found (#35)

## [0.2] - 2021-09-26

### Added
- UAD now comes with a logger. Debug information will be written to a `uad.log` file (Warning level log in *stdout*) (#2)
- Support for older phone (< Android 8.0) (#15):
- Disable mode in settings: clear and disable packages instead of uninstalling them (default for old phones because you can't restore uninstalled packages)
- Export your selection in the `uad_exported_selection.txt` file. Packages from this file (if found in the current directory) will be automatically selected upon the start of UAD (or after a refresh) (#8)

### Changed
- UAD will no longer crash at start if it doesn't find ADB but will display a useful error message (#25)
- Better handling of ADB errors (#3)
- Updated dependencies (compatibility with [Iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced) main branch latest commit)
- Cleanup and refactoring of the code
- Performance improvement
- Various UI/UX improvement
- The `Debloat/Restore selection` button has been split in 2 buttons: `removing` and `restoring`

## Packaging
- Added an alternative build that uses [OpenGL](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL) (instead of [Vulkan](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan_(API))) for compatibility with older computers. If you encouter some visual glitches with the default Vulkan build you should try the OpenGL build.

### Fixed
- Spelling mistake
- Failed build with MSVC toolchain
